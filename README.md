# style

*One style is all that is needed.*

Principles:

* markup is semantic and minimal
* markdown is the sole source for primary page content
* a site's style handles..
  1. any HTML generated from markdown
  2. ancillary elements (header, nav, footer)
  3. nothing else
* classes are only used outside the context of primary page content, and only when absolutely necessary
* bandwidth is not assumed to be broadband -- the site loads and functions quickly in suboptimal conditions
